    "Python libraries, that is. Python is of course open source, and many developers create libraries (aka packages, aka modules) that you can import. This is wonderful because it means you don't have to write your own code from scratch. You can just use tools others have created to accomplish a task.\n",

For example, 'pip install requests'. The [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module is for requesting urls over the internet. (We'll use that later)\n",
